# web-scraping
The task was to write some code that scrapes property name, property type (e.g Apartment),
number of bedrooms, bathrooms and list of the amenities for the following 3 properties:
https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/33571268
https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/20669368
https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/50633275

## Solution
I used Cheerio to web-scrape the pages. This is the first time I have used Cheerio and found it difficult to retrieve all of the data that was required. 
I shall have another look at this task when I have some more experience of web-scraping.
